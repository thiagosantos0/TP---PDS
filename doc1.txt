Niners head coach Mike Singletary will let Alex Smith remain his starting 
quarterback, but his vote of confidence is anything but a long-term mandate.
Smith now will work on a week-to-week basis, because Singletary has voided 
his year-long lease on the job.
"I think from this point on, you have to do what's best for the football team,"
Singletary said Monday, one day after threatening to bench Smith during a 
27-24 loss to the visiting Eagles.Teste teste teste teste
